## Smart Contract Architecture:

# Payment Types
```
enum PaymentType {
    Direct,
    Escrow
}
```

# Order Status
```
enum OrderStatus {
    Pending,
    Completed,
    Refunded,
    Disputed
}
```
## Core Functions:

# Create Direct Payment
```
createDirectPayment(address seller)
```
Transfers ETH instantly to seller.

# Create Escrow Payment
```
createEscrowPayment(address seller)
```
Locks ETH inside smart contract.

# Confirm Receipt
```
confirmReceipt(uint256 orderId)
```
Buyer releases escrow funds to seller.

# Refund
```
refund(uint256 orderId)
```
Seller refunds buyer.

# Open Dispute
```
openDispute(uint256 orderId)
```
Buyer or seller opens dispute.

# Resolve Dispute
```
resolveDispute(uint256 orderId, bool releaseToSeller)
```
Arbitrator resolves dispute.

## Security Logic

# The contract prevents:

Double confirmations
Double refunds
Invalid state transitions
Unauthorized dispute resolutions
Unauthorized refunds
Unauthorized confirmations
Resolving non-disputed orders
Using escrow logic on direct payments
